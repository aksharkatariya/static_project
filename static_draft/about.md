# Food For Thought

Akshar Katariya

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?
My current goal is to create a set of visualizations that give the reader a sense of where the world stands with emissions of GHGs due to food consumption. In the initial few charts, I want to show a macro perspective
and then dive deep into exploriong some trends that are important for the climate change discourse. It has largely remained  the same since the proposal. 

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?
I am not operating on mock data, but there are a few challenges. 
-  I feel like I am struggling with manipulating the data for the exact chart I need. For example, with the lollipop chart, I wanted to convey the global change over the last few years, but it is not striking enough to convery that
-  My data needs to be appended with other relevant data such as population, democracy status, to create more nuanced and interesting charts
- I am unable to manipulate the axes titles when I have used faceting
- I am unsure on how to make the boxes in the boxplots wider and more visible.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.
present in the jupyter notebook

## What form do you envision your final deliverable taking? (An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)
It is somewhere between an article and an inforgraphic. I don't think I will be writing that many paragraphs, but I do want to steer the story and go deeper into exploring some trends, and for that I will need to write some words around my charts.
