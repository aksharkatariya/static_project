Static Project for CAPP 30239

Note: I am submitting this a day after the deadline as I joined the course late and received permission from professor to get a 24 hour extension on this. Thank you.

## Proposal 1:

Description of the subject area of choice: Aid: Many developing countries face immediate, pressing challenges such as poverty alleviation, infrastructure development, healthcare, education. However, international organizations, like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), or United Nations (UN), often prioritize broader, global agendas that don’t always align perfectly with the urgent local needs. For example, while environmental sustainability or governance reforms are important globally, a country in crisis might prioritize economic recovery, food security, or health over climate change mitigation efforts

Description: This dataset contains responses from nearly 7,000 leaders working in 23 development policy areas. The survey provides insights into how leaders in low- and lower-middle-income countries evaluate the performance and influence of over 100 development partners. It highlights the gap between development priorities as seen by local leaders and international organizations' agendas. I plan on using it to show country-wise priorities of their developmental SDG goals. I also plan to analyze how leaders perceive the urgency of different development agendas in specific sectors like health, education, infrastructure, etc in their own countries. 

Size of data: Approximately 6 CSV files with at about ~7000 rows in the largest dataset containing global, regional, and sectoral aggregates of development partner performance, with hundreds of rows (depending on the aggregation level) and over 20 columns detailing different dimensions like influence and helpfulness​

## Proposal 2:

Description of the subject area of choice: Climate Change: Emissions from food and packaging are significant contributors to global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, exacerbating climate change. These emissions arise at various stages of the food production and consumption chain, from agricultural practices to packaging and waste management

Description: EDGAR-FOOD has been developed to aid the understanding of the activities underlying the energy demand and use, agriculture and land use change emissions associated with the production, distribution, consumption and disposal of food through the various stages and sectors of the composite global food system. I plan to use the data to quantify and compare greenhouse gas emissions from different stages of the food system (e.g., land-use change, transportation, processing). This could help identify where the largest emission hotspots are in the global or regional food supply chain and inform policy recommendations for emission reduction.

Size of the data: 13584 rows describing each country's emissions at each food system's stage in the last 53 years. 

Questions: Which one of these is more feasible or interesting given that we are making static charts. Which topic of these 2 can be understood better with visualizations?
