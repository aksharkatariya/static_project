# What in the F-gases..?

**Author:** Akshar Katariya

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the trends in fluorinated gases (F-gases) emissions and their impact on global warming. Using data from various sources, the project aims to highlight the increasing emissions of F-gases and their significance in climate change. It also explores the industrial and economic reasons for the rise in emissions. 

The analysis includes a breakdown of emissions by country and sector, revealing which industrial applications—such as refrigeration, air conditioning, and certain manufacturing processes—are the most significant contributors. Furthermore, the project discusses the socio-economic implications of F-gas emissions, especially in developing nations, where industrial growth often coincides with rising greenhouse gas emissions. 

By employing data visualization techniques, the project provides clear and compelling insights into the trends and patterns of F-gas emissions, emphasizing the urgent need for targeted international mitigation efforts. This work aims to inform policymakers, researchers, and the public about the pressing issue of F-gas emissions and encourage the adoption of more sustainable practices across industries and economy types.
